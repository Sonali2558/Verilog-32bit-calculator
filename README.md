# 32bit-Floating-point-ALU
- A 32-bit floating point arithmetic unit (FPU) that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on two 32-bit floating point numbers.
- In this project, an 8-bit Kogge-Stone adder was built first.
- Using this adder, an ALU was built to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, NOT and XOR between two 8-bit numbers.
- A 32-bit floating point arithmetic unit (FPU) capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on two 32-bit floating point numbers was built using the ALU.
- The FPU was designed entirely in Verilog and synthesized using the Xilinx Vivado tool. The functionality of FPU was tested using test benches.
